Cloud Temple|Gilmore: Hey, hey, Mr. Voice.What a coincidence.It's called the Cloud Temple soI wondered if it had somethingto do with the Cloud Gate.Well, it's a bit of tourism.How about you?How is your investigation is going?|Gilmore: Let's stop chewing thefat here. Go find the Cloud Gateas soon as possible.|Nasca: This is the altar I waslooking for...What on Earth is it used for?|Nasca: It seems that this place wassealed...By performing some kind of ritualat this altar, the seal will bebroken.However, that ritual must have beenlong lost.What exactly was sealed?|Nasca: It's unimportant, you mustbe on a treasure hunt, but......I found a text, in my research,that indicates the location of atreasure. Do you want to hear it?|I think I've talked about thisbefore...do you want to hear me?       YES         NO|Nasca: It was written in an ancientdocument found on this planet."Sacred inland sea, look at thesurface from the southeast,it looks like a face in profile.Hide despair in the eyesand hope behind the nose..."Perhaps there are two hiddentreasures. Just my intuitionas an archaeologist.|Nasca:...We talked about it before.|Nasca: Did you write that down?       YES         NO|Nasca: Have a good hunt.I hope you find something.|
