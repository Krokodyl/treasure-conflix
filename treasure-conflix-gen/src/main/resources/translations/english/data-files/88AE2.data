Peppermint|Johan: Now, I'm transportingmachine parts to Landos Base.There are parts here that theydon't have over there.But the ship smells like machineoil...|Keane: Do you want to exchangejunk for money?       YES         NO|Keane: You don't have anything!Hunters are supposed to gotreasure hunting!|Keane: Whatever!There's no business for honesthunters here.|Serge: The workshops here are thebest in the world.After all, I'm the one in charge.Of course, small shops are alsoexcellent.But if you want my services,there's a 6-months wait.I'm quite busy.|Serge: I work on ships but I alsodo detailed work.For example...a prosthetic leg.I made one for Red Spade.He had it since childhood.He came for repairs the other day.He looked frustrated.When he was younger, he'd make thesame face after losing a fight.I was asked to tune up his shipalong with his leg, so I'm surehe's going to fight someone soon.|Leon: Beyond the headland west ofhere lies the Doom Triangle.There, ships disappear suddenly.The legend says that the ships aredrifting in the sea.All those parts that could bereused, it's a shame...|Keane: Uh? The Cloud Gate?{0...That will be 5000.       YES         NO|Keane: Come back with money.|Keane: Alright, let me tell youwhere the Cloud Gate is now.It was stolen from a hiddenvillage a year ago.Naturally, after that, it passedthrough my hands to be handed overto a certain person.I guess you want to find who thatperson is. But some idiot useda boat for transportation.I can tell this fool is not fromthis planet.After all, he tried to pass throughthe Doom Triangle on a boat.As expected, he was never able toreach his destination. We lostall contact with him abruptly.|In other words, the Cloud Gateis in the Doom Triangle sea.If you want it, you'll haveto dive for it.If you do, make sure you know howto get back to the surface.Ha ha.|Keane: I told you!The Cloud Gate sank at thebottom of the Doom Triangle.|Silva: Oh, Voice.I wrecked the ship again.I have to wait six months here...|Silva: I think I should quitbeing a hunter and find anotherjob...|Keane: Hey! Do you have 5000?       YES         NO|Keane: Do you want intel on an oldthieves stash for 1000?       YES         NO|Keane: Way to go.|Listen carefully.It's quite simple.There's a mountain range outsideof Landos Base.Gold is hidden in one of thevalleys.|...I don't have anything to sayto you.|Fine...{0I won't tell you anything.|You don't have enough money.|Did you get it?       YES         NO|If you want to hear it, you mustpay again. Are you sure?       YES         NO|Good luck!If you don't find it soon,other hunters will. Heh heh.|
