Salvage Ship|Rag: Glad to see you.I'm the captain, Rag.You can treat my ship as your own.A Cloud Gate?I haven't pulled up anythinglike that.If you want it so badly,why not search for it yourself?We can mod your airship in theworkshop so that you can divein the sea.|Hahaha...Are you surprised?The mechanic who joined us is odd,but they're brilliant.It's thanks to them that we're ableto operate in this area.Go to the workshop and meet them.|Rag: The sky is nice, but so isthe ocean. It is also deep.You'll find that out soon enough.|Rag: Do you have treasures to sell?       YES         NO|Rag: If you find treasures,bring them to me.|Rag: We don't know why but thewater here has a differentcomposition.The water quality could explainwhy ships are sinking.This ship has been speciallymodified for this areaon Aleph's advice.By the looks of it, that'sworking well.|However, other seas are lessstable and so it makes worseconditions.That's why a modified shipcan only dive in this area.That's expected.|Rag: The situation is dire butremember...When the sea gets rough,it's crucial not to be afraidand not to panic.|Loud: Voice! What's going on?What!Gilmore took the Cloud Gate!?|Damn...I arrived too late...|I found out who he really is.He's a former soldier who stageda military coup on Kireth.His arrest warrant arrived today.I got here late because I waswaiting for the file to arrive.According to the warrant,he's a member of a secret societythat's also involved in the coup.This organization is trying torevive the power of the ancientcivilization.He must have been looking forthe Cloud Gate to break the sealand obtain that power.And maybe he knows how to breakthe seal. Who knows what wouldhappen if the seal is broken...{ Let's go the Hidden Villageand ask around to find out.I'll come with you as I don't haveanything to do in town.|Loud: The survivors of the ancientsknow something about what happenswhen the seal is broken.|
