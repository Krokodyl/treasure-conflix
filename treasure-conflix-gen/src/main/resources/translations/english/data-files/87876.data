Kazusa Base|Lisa: Are you looking for theCloud Gate?I know it's an ancient treasure.Even though I look like this,I'm a well-informed person.Come to think of it,I think I heard an old collectortalk about it in some town.|Lisa: Did you find the Cloud Gate?...It's not that easy to find.But isn't that the real thrill oftreasure hunting?After all, it's a pleasure to findsomething after all the hard work.Even more so if it's a legendarytreasure...|Lisa: Eh!? The Cloud Gate youfound was stolen!?What are you doing?Get it together!If they steal it, take it back!That's the code of the treasurehunters!|Lisa: Hurry up! Go get theCloud Gate back!Don't let them get away with that!|Johan: I'm transporting fish toPeppermint.The fish here are delicious butthen the ship smells fishy...|Nova: Recently there's been a lotof damage from air pirates,so insurance premiums have gone up.Good grief, they should raise thehazard pay as well.Tough times to be a pilot.|Nova: They finally raised thehazard pay but that'd be worthlessif you get shot down by pirates.|Nova: Piloting is a dangerous jobbut it's better than crossing theDoom Triangle in a watercraft.You see, the color of the sea isdifferent beyond the cape thatgoes all the way north from here.That's the Doom Triangle.I'd rather be killed by the skypirates than die over there.|Lisa: There was a man with a canehere...was it Red Spade?Don't you know?He's been limping since a childhoodaccident. That's why he's obsessedwith airship speed.Who was the other man?He gave off a weird vibe...|Nova: I dropped a visitor fromRaizeltown that was lookingvery suspicious.I did get paid though.|
